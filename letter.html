                Ammu, Happy Valentines Day my love🥹🤍. Happy that you choose me as your Valentine again and this time you asked me to be your Valentine🥹 that’s highlight of this Valentine to me. I have never experienced being asked/I don’t remember any situation that occurred. To me Valentine was always Tata’s birthday, another day where I get perfumes and that’s all. When you came in, it changed. I love doing something with efforts for you😘. You always make me feel worth it. Without you, I would have been the person I am today and I promise to choose you always yesterday, today, tomorrow and every other day till my last breath. This last whole year was a transition year for me. From bad to good. From selfish to loyal but yet I know I lack a lot here and there. That’s where I am making myself to be right so I can make all your love and efforts worth it🥰. Thanks for making my life happier, brighter where I see a great future waiting for me. My mum is defensive but one day she will understand you. She will be grateful I brought you home🥺. She will treat you like her own daughter. That’s all I want. I am focusing a lot and trying to be on track because it’s a crucial year. Not because of final year or FYP but it’s my BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY to prove my parents and make them accept our love. This is a challenge that I never wanted to attempt or even bothered to care previously but now this is my life. I am sorry for annoying you, for not giving you proper updates, for not being supportive at times or even prioritising myself and let you feel lonely. Believe me ma🥺🤍 I am working on myself . I am not being hard but reminding myself to not fucking this relationship and life that I feel gods last chance for me. I am super grateful for a wife like you who made me CTO of our company and generate abit income that can make me finally be by my own instead of looking for my parents support. Thanks a lot baby🤍🥰. Hope you love this small effort that I do from scratch. I will always love you this way and never even lessen it. I will always be by your side and admire you. I promise to be loyal, honest, transparent always no matter what because I can’t even imagine a life or future without you. I love you so much baby girl and once again Happiest Valentines Ammu🤍✨
